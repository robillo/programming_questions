# Programming Questions for Interview Preparation

This repositories hosts various programming questions that one person should cover before applying for programming interviews. Programming (Data Structures and Algorithms) make the foundation of a good programmer, and only questions related to programming are asked (and not of a particular Specialization) while giving an interview in any good company. It is recommended to any IT specialist or beginner to go through these questions / algorithms thoroughly.

## Following programming questions are present in this repository with near-best time complexities:
